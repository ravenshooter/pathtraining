# Path Training

This git is for all students that have been sitting in algorithms lectures, studying graph search and shortest path algorithms.

It's a java library that visualises open street map data and easily allows students to try out different graph algorithms.

All visualisation and UI is taken care of, so that you can focus on implementing the pure algorithm.


## Example code

For an example see the [breadth first search](/src/sample/BFS.java) in the samples folder. 


## UI

This is how the UI looks like. Data is pulled from open street map. Nodes can be colored in differently to mark open or closed nodes. Discovery and close times can be displayed on demand. By hovering over a node additional information is shown in the top right corner.
