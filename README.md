# Path Training

This git is for all students that have been sitting in algorithms lectures, studying graph search and shortest path algorithms.

It's a java library that visualises open street map data and easily allows students to try out different graph algorithms.

All visualisation and UI is taken care of, so that you can focus on implementing the pure algorithm.

For an example see the [breadth first search](/src/sample/BFS.java) in the samples folder.
